Note: this is a computational lab, and quantitative skills are highly valued. Tailored computational training programs are a possibility for enthusiastic students without a quantitative background.\nStarting in 2025, we will also recruit Biostatistics PhD students.\nWe are open to co-mentorship opportunities as well with other labs."

    "text": "Germline determinants of somatic mosaicism\nPrevious and ongoing work leverages biobank scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of blood to detect pre-malignant clonal expansions and to discover their germline determinants and phenotypic correlates. We are particularly interested in the germline determinants of clonal expansions of somatic point mutations in blood, spanning both leukemogenic point mutations as well as relatively uncharacterized recurrent non-coding point mutations."

    "text": "Gene regulatory networks + complex traits\nWe are interested in the characterization of the trans-regulatory cascade of disease-associated regulatory variation discovered by GWAS. We are particularly enthusiastic about high-throughput CRISPR perturbation approaches paired with bespoke statistical methods for computationally inferring gene regulatory networks. Our perspective is that these gene regulatory networks offer rich mechanistic insight into otherwise opaque GWAS loci.\n\nOur lab furthers this mission though bespoke computational methods development and application. Our model has been to partner closely with experimentalists to develop statistical approaches that reflect deep biological and experimental intuition. We ultimately aspire to mitigate common disease burden through our discovery and characterization of novel therapeutic targets."

    "text": "I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Human Genetics at Emory University. My lab uses statistical and machine learning approaches to discover and characterize disease associated genetic variation. Previously, I was a postdoctoral scholar working jointly with Jonathan Pritchard (Stanford, Genetics) and Alexis Battle (Johns Hopkins, Biomedical Engineering), and then an Assistant Research Scientist in the Battle Lab. I completed a PhD in the Biostatistics department of the University of Michigan, where I was advised by Goncalo Abecasis. At Michigan, my contributions included analysis of somatic variation called from whole genomes generated by the NHLBI TOPMed consortium. I have also consulted for a number of years with a Major League Baseball team on sports statistics."
