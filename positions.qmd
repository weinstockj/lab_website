## PhD Students

We are taking rotation students from the Genetics and Molecular Biology (GMB) program. Please contact Josh if you are interested in a rotation. Note: this is a computational lab, and quantitative skills are highly valued. Tailored computational training programs are a possibility for enthusiastic students without a 
quantitative background. 

Starting in 2025, we will also recruit Biostatistics PhD students. 

We are open to co-mentorship opportunities as well with other labs. 

## Postdocs 

Your application should include a cover letter describing your interest in our work. It would be ideal to propose a specific project that aligns with our interests and is distinct from your previous work. Please include your CV and a list of references. 

Postdoc candidates should have a PhD in 
genetics, biostatistics, computer science, epidemiology, biomedical engineering, or similar. Candidates should have at least one first-author publication in a peer-reviewed journal. 

## Undergraduates

We are accepting applications from undergraduates with interests that align with our research program. Please contact Josh with your interests, and suggest an idea that you have for a project.
