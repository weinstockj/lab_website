I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Human
Genetics at Emory University. My lab uses statistical and
machine learning approaches to discover and characterize
disease associated genetic variation. Previously, I was a postdoctoral scholar working jointly with Jonathan Pritchard (Stanford, Genetics) and Alexis Battle (Johns Hopkins, Biomedical Engineering), and then an Assistant Research Scientist in the Battle Lab. I completed a PhD in the Biostatistics department of the University of Michigan, where I was advised by Goncalo Abecasis. At Michigan, my contributions included analysis of somatic variation called from whole genomes generated by the NHLBI TOPMed consortium. I have also consulted for a number of years with a Major League Baseball team on sports statistics.
